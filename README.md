# NeoVim Config

Nothing interesting, just my neovim setup.

## Fresh Install Instructions
After a fresh install of this repo, you need to
- Install Packer plugin manager: [Here](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim#quickstart) 
- Run `composer install` inside of Phpactor LSP (since it will be installed with Packer, its location is probably `/home/redb/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/phpactor`)
- Run `:PackerSync`
